We'll need to signup for a developer account and create an app to host our applicaiton logic:

https://api.slack.com/apps

![The create app dialog once pressed "create app"](./create-app-dialog.png)

![The initial screen that'll be shown when a new app is created](./initial-screen.png)

We're even able to customize the look of our application in our Slack settings:

![Towards the bottom of the intial page will show how to customize the description and such](./display-info.png)

Luckily for us, Slack provides a SDK to provide functionality to a Slack app:

https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk

In order to quickly set it up, we'll run the following command:

```
npm install @slack/web-api @slack/events-api
```

We'll then be able to use their example API:

```javascript
// index.js
// Initialize using signing secret from environment variables
const { createEventAdapter } = require('@slack/events-api');
const slackEvents = createEventAdapter(process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET);
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Attach listeners to events by Slack Event "type". See: https://api.slack.com/events/message.im
slackEvents.on('message', (event) => {
  console.log(`Received a message event: user ${event.user} in channel ${event.channel} says ${event.text}`);
});

// Handle errors (see `errorCodes` export)
slackEvents.on('error', console.error);

// Start a basic HTTP server
slackEvents.start(port).then(() => {
  // Listening on path '/slack/events' by default
  console.log(`server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

This will `console.log` every time a user sends a message. 
Save this to `index.js`. 

Another thing that will need to be kept in mind is how to store the signing secret. As the above code hints at, it's suggested to use an environmental file or configuration.

To make development easier, we'll setup a `.env` file with the expected credentials and run `env-cmd` to host all of our projects:

```
npm i env-cmd
```

This will look for a `.env` file and inject it into your command that follows `env-cmd`. So, for example, you can make a new file called `.env` and place the following contents in it:

```
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=<SIGNING_SECRET_FROM_HOMESCREEN>
```

Then, in your `package.json`, you can edit your `start` command to reflect the following:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "env-cmd node ./index.js"
  }
}
```

## Development Hosting {#development-environment-setup}

In order to have these events called, we'll need to get a public URL to route to. In order to do this, we can use `ngrok` to host a public URL in our local environment:

```
npm i -D ngrok
npx ngrok http 3000
```

> Keep in mind that this should NOT be used to host your Slack application when you're ready to publish.
> This should only be used during development process. In order to see how to deploy, you'll want to checkout [the section on doing so using Heroku](#heroku)

After doing so, you should be given an `ngrok.io` subdomain to map to your local IP address with a message like the following:

```
Forwarding https://9fca9f3e.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000
```

![Showing ngrok running in the terminal](./ngrok-running.png)

We're now able to use this URL as a map to the external world to the local environment we're in. So, for example, in order to add in the events subscription to our current code, we'll run the following commmand:

```
./node_modules/.bin/slack-verify --secret <signing_secret>
```

Where the `<signing_secret>` is the same signing secret from the homepage you landed on upon creating a new Slack app

![Showing the command running](./slack-verify.png)

With this command still running, you can press on the "Add features and functionality" tab in the homescreen, then press "Event Subscriptions".

This will bring you to a page with an "On/Off" toggle. Toggle it to "On" and add the `ngrok` domain in the request URL

![Adding the ngrok domain into the "event subscription" area ](./event-subscription-enable.png)

But the domain isn't saved yet. We first need to add workspace events to subscribe to. This is to ensure that any app doesn't simply have root permissions to everything for privacy and security's sake

![Searching for oauth permissions to add to the event handler](./searching_events.png)

Let's say we want to handle all of the public messages to a channel, we can add `message.channels` to get the permissions to do so.

![After adding the permission and the app is saved, it should look like this](./added_channels_read.png)

If you look through the code that we now have in the `index.js` file, you'll see that we're listening for `messages`:

```javascript
slackEvents.on('message', (event) => {
  console.log(`Received a message event: user ${event.user} in channel ${event.channel} says ${event.text}`);
});
```

But here we're requesting `message.channels`, how do we know that those two match each other?

You can actually check the event `type` from [the API reference documentation](https://api.slack.com/events/message.channels) to see that the `type`s match up.

## Installation {#development-installation}

## Deployment {#deployment}

We'll then want to deploy
